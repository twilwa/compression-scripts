# compression-scripts
random utilities i write/use to fill in the gap between "thing i know" and "thing i need to know to do the thing"

please feel free to submit PR's to the repo with any useful utilities you've made to help you in your day-to-day work, and update the README for the appropriate branch accordingly (after creating it, of course!)
the branch should have a descriptive title based on the task you're building utilities for, so someone can tell if they're working on the same thing at a glance when looking at all the branches.

this README will remain the one that describes the overall scope of the project -- your README should include instructions of how to replicate your process such that someone can have the same amount of per-task compression as you, provided they take a deep breath and think step-by-step while working through the instructions. ;)

happy compressing frens :D
