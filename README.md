# compression-scripts
random utilities i write/use to fill in the gap between "thing i know" and "thing i need to know to do the thing"

please feel free to submit PR's to the appropraite branch of the repo with any useful utilities you've made to help you in your day-to-day work on a similar task, and update the README for the appropriate branch accordingly. if you're looking for a collection of helpful stuff for a thing you're doing, check out the list of branches, and if you've made something, create a new branch for it! :)
the branch should have a descriptive title based on the task you're building utilities for, so someone can tell if they're working on the same thing at a glance when looking at all the branches.

this README will remain the one that describes the overall scope of the project -- your README should include instructions of how to replicate your process such that someone can have the same amount of per-task compression as you, provided they take a deep breath and think step-by-step while working through the instructions. ;)

happy compressing frens :D
